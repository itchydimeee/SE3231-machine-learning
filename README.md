QUESTION AND ANSWER

1. Why did you choose this dataset?

-  As someone who loves playing games, I am interested in how gaming affects school grades. I believe it can have a negative impact if overused and not managed responsibly. However, it may also help develop skills like critical thinking, decision-making, and quick thinking, which are often overlooked. Choosing this dataset allows me to explore the connection between gaming and academic performance.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

-  Using playing hours as the independent variable and grades as the dependent variable in single linear regression, and including playing years, playing hours, playing games, and both parents' education levels in multiple linear regression, the results show no clear linear trend. While some predicted values align closely with actual values, the data remains widely spread, making it difficult to identify a consistent pattern. This suggests that gaming alone does not directly determine students' grades, as other factors outside the scope of gaming also play a role.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

-  Linear Regression remains very relevant, especially in data science. It serves as a fundamental tool for understanding relationships between variables, making predictions, and identifying trends.
